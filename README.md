- Jest unit testing (+ Enzyme)

## üì¶ Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/hodgef/electron-webpack-boilerplate.git my-app
npm install
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This boilerplate uses `nodeIntegration` by default, which allows your renderer code to access node. Only use this boilerplate if you are running trusted code in your app. Alternatively, you can change this setting in `src/main/index.ts` and adjust accordingly.

## üíé Customization

> Before shipping, make sure to:

1. Edit `LICENSE` file
2. Edit `package.json` information (This will be used to package your app)
3. (Optional) Set-up releases, code signing, notarization for your app. Additional docs on this coming soon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

- Use `npm start` to develop your app with Hot Reloading on changes.
- Use `npm serve:dist` to serve a semi-production app from the build folder.
- Use `npm run dist` to build executables for your app, according to the information in your package.json.
- Use `npm run test` to run unit tests for your app.
